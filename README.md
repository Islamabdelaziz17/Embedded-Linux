## Concepts

-  **Static & Dynamic libraries**: Differences and how to statically or dynamically link those libraries with the running application

## Components

- **Crosstool-NG**: A toolchain generator for building cross-compiling toolchains.

## Usage
To use this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for building the system, such as `gcc`, `make`, and `libssl-dev`.
3. Choose the appropriate tool for building the system, such as Buildroot or Yocto.
4. Follow the instructions in the tool's documentation to configure and build the system.

## Conclusion
